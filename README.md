PRISM Break Secure Email is a powerful solution for secure email exchange on BlackBerry® 10 devices. It is suitable for individual users as well as corporations in demand of secure communication among its employees.

The app differentiates itself from other similar solutions in BlackBerry World with these unique qualities:
* It enables FREE READING of secure messages and FREE SENDING of secure messages with up to 50 characters. Only the sender of email messages with more than 50 characters needs to buy the app. You can send an unlimited number of characters and attach an external file after you enable the full functionality by purchasing the app.
* It uses asymmetric cryptography (RSA 1024-bit) BUT ALSO SWITCHES TO SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION (AES 256-bit) if a public key is not provided.
* It enables seamless sending and reading of secure email messages DIRECTLY FROM THE HUB.
* It enables ATTACHING ONE EXTERNAL FILE. 

PRISM Break Secure Email protects your email messages in two efficient ways:
* It protects your encrypted email messages with a password.
* It encrypts your email messages using asymmetric cryptography with two keys (public and private). Asymmetric cryptography uses your public key to encrypt the messages sent to you. That's why you have to exchange it (within the app) with your communication partners to avoid the much less efficient symmetric encryption being used automatically. On the other hand, your private key is kept secret and is safely stored on your device. That'€™s why you are the only one who can read the messages.

With its BlackBerry® Enterprise Service 10 (BES 10), BlackBerry® provides the most secure messaging amongst all the devices on today'€™s market. However, this level of security is only provided while the email message is being transmitted between your device and BES 10, since emails are stored on email servers (e.g. Microsoft® Exchange Server, IBM Lotus® Domino, etc.) and can be easily accessed by server administrators. Email messages are thus secure for email server owners (corporations and organizations) but not for individual device users. Their privacy is compromised (especially if they don't use BES 10).

This hub-integrated native application, developed using BlackBerry® Cascades, makes excellent use of the device power, offers a unique BlackBerry® 10 user experience, and efficiently protects your content.
