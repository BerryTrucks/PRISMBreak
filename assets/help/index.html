    		<b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> is a secure email solution for BlackBerry® 10 devices.
    	</p>

    	<p>
			BlackBerry® devices are the most secure devices in the world and together with BlackBerry® 
			Enterprise Service 10 (in short, BES 10) they provide the most secure messaging. But those security 
			works only on a transport layer between BlackBerry® devices and BES 10 servers. Unfortunately the email messages 
			are still stored on email servers (e.g., Microsoft® Exchange Server, IBM Lotus® Domino, etc.) 
			and any administrator of those servers can easily access to your messages stored there. 
			That means email messages are highly secure for email server owners (corporations, companies and organizations) 
			but not for user personally. Your privacy is on stake! And if you don't use BES 10 at all,
			your transport layer may not be secure, too.
    	</p>
    	<p>
			The <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> application protects your messages in two ways:
			<ul>
				<li>It <b>encrypts</b> your email messages with an asymmetric or symmetric encryption 
				(the app is using a built-in <b>BlackBerry Library for the Security Builder Government Security Edition SB GSE-C</b> that is also known as 
				<b>BlackBerry OS Cryptographic Kernel</b>), and</li>
				<li>It wraps your encrypted messages into <b>password-protected</b> envelope.</li>
			</ul>
    	</p>
    	<p>
			The asymmetric cryptography (<b>RSA-1024</b>) uses your 1024-bit <b>public key</b> to encrypt the messages sent 
			to you. That's why you have to share your public key to your communication parties otherwise <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> will
			switch to symmetric encryption (<b>AES-256</b>). <b><u>We don't advise that!!!</u></b>. Because you are the 
			only owner of your 1024-bit <b>private key</b> that is safely stored on your device, you are the only one 
			that can read those messages.
    	</p>

			<img src="img/asym_enc.jpg"/>
		</p>
     	<p>
			If the <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> application switches to symmetric cryptography (<b>AES-256</b>), a special 
			256-bit <b>security key</b> is used to encrypt messages. Although the key is unique for each user, we advise you to switch 
			to asymmetric cryptography as soon as possible by exchanging public keys.
    	</p>

        <h1>1. Setup</h1>
        <p>
        	Before you can start using the <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> application, you need to set it up by choosing a password and creating asymmetric keys (one public key and one private key). You can also create backup of both keys or restore them from a secure backup file. 
        </p>
        <p>
			All these steps are performed with a <b>setup wizard</b> in four basic steps.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1: Welcome Screen</h3>
        <p>
        	Before starting setup, please read the <b>privacy policy</b> and the <b>end-user's license agreement</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
			If you agree with both, you can move to the next step by tapping on the <b><u>Next</u></b> action.
        </p>
    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/w1.png"/>
    	</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Password Set Screen</h3>
        <p>
        	Your first action is to set a password that will be used in the <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> application. 
			It must contain at least <u>6 characters</u> and must be re-typed correctly. Keep in mind that the more characters you have, the harder it is to crack the password. You can always change the password later. The password is also used to decrease the pseudo-random generator's vulnerability and to prevent regeneration of both keys. 
        </p>
        <p>
			You can move to the next step by tapping on the <b><u>Next</u></b> action.
        </p>
    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/w2.png"/>
    	</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Asymmetric Keys Generation Screen</h3>
        <p>
        	On the next screen, you need to generate your 1024-bit asymmetric keys: one <b>public</b> key and one 
        	<b>private</b> key. The public key is used for encrypting messages. You always use recipients'
        	public keys to do that. To decrypt the messages, you need to use your own private key. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The keys are created with a pseudo-random generator which is proven to be rather vulnerable, since the process of the key creation can be determined. This threat is eliminated by 
			combining pseudo-random generator with your password and a virtual image that you draw on the screen. 
			The password and the drawn image together decrease the pseudo-random generator's vulnerability and prevent regeneration of both keys. 	
        </p>
        <p>
        	To start generating the asymmetric keys, tap somewhere on the screen and drag your finger drawing a virtual image until the progress meter shows movement. A randomly drawn virtual image generates an additional set of initial values for the key generation which is crucial for the security of your keys.
        </p>
        <p>
			You can move to the last step by tapping on the <b><u>Next</u></b> action. 
        </p>
    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/w3.png"/>
    	</p>
        <h3>Step 4: Keys Backup or Restore Screen</h3>
        <p>
        	The last screen offers an option to backup or restore your asymmetric keys.
        </p>
        <p>
			If you are seting up the <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> application for the first time, it is advisable to backup your keys to your local drive, SD memory card or remotely on cloud (DropBox or Box). You need to set another 			password which is used as an AES-256 key for the symmetric encryption of the backup file.
        </p>
        <p>
			If you have already backed-up your keys, you can restore them from your password-protected file on your local drive, 
			SD memory card or remotely on cloud (DropBox or Box) to be able to read your older messages that use the old keys. This way there is no need to reshare your public key.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The keys are stored in a file called <b>prism.keys</b> which are encrypted with the <b>AES-256</b> symmetric encryption using its own
			<b>backup password</b> as a secure key. Keep in mind that the <b>backup password</b> is not the same as the <b>password</b> used
        	in the <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> application (although it could be). The password is recommended to be at least 32 characters long to fill all 256 bytes of your key. <b>Note:</b> <i>the longer the password, the more secure your backup file.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Tap on the <b><u>Complete</u></b> action to finalize the setup steps.

        <h1>2. Application Center</h1>
        <p>
        	The application has three main tabs. It always starts in the composer tab where you can start 
			composing new secure messages and send them via email.
        </p>
        <p>
        	On the left bottom part of the main screen, you can find the tab selection icon. Tap on it to open the menu for switching between the three tabs:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Composer</b> tab for creating new messages,</li>
				<li><b>Inbox</b> tab for reading received messages and replying, and</li>

			</ul>
        </p>
    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/tabs.png"/>
    	</p>
        <p>
        	The main function of the <b>Composer</b> tab is to compose a new secure message, which can contain one attachment, and send it from
			the email account. 
			Additionally, the <b>Composer</b> tab can be used for  sending the public key via email.
        </p>
    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/composer.png"/>
    	</p>
        <p>
        	The <b>Inbox</b> tab shows a list of all received and sent secure messages and is used for reading, editing, replying and forwarding messages.

    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/inbox.png"/>
    	</p>
        <p>
        	On the <b>Key Info</b> tab, you can find information about your asymmetric keys.
        </p>
        <p>
			The public key URL starts with <b>prismkey://</b> and is registered in BlackBerry® 10 OS to open a <b>PRISM Break Secure Email</b> key import card.
        </p>
        <p>
			From the <b>Key Info</b> tab, you can backup your security keys, restore them, regenerate them, or reset the password.

		<p>
		    Composer is used to create a secure message that contains a message body and optionally one attached file.
		</p>
        <p>
        	There are two ways to set the recepient:
			<ul>
				<li>By tapping on the <b>TO:</b> text field, or</li>
				<li>By selecting the <b>Set Recepient</b> menu item.</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
		<p>
		    In both cases, the contact picker pops up and a contact must be selected. If the contact has more than one email addresses, you need to choose one.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <b>WARNING:</b> You can send the secure messages only to recepients that are stored in your contacts!
		</p>
		<p>
		    <b>WARNING:</b> Because only one public key is used to encrypt the message, only one recepient can be set per message!
		</p>
    	<p align="center">
    		<img src="img/recepient.png"/>
    	</p>
         <p>
